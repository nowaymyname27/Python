The projects in this repository depend on the following Python libraries:
- Tkinter (standard library in Python, no need for installation)
- ttkbootstrap

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries, use pip:

```
pip install ttkbootstrap
```
**Note:** Tkinter is included in the standard Python library and does not require installation.

## Usage
Each project contains a main.py file which you can run to start the application:

```
python main.py
```
In some projects, additional instructions may be provided in the respective project directory.
